Project Title: EnergiSense
AI-Powered Smart Optimization for Power Plant Efficiency and Loss Reduction

1. Problem Statement
Modern power plants, including thermal, hydro, and solar, often suffer from energy inefficiencies due to a combination of factors:

Manual control loops or poorly tuned PID systems.

Transmission and distribution losses.

Lack of real-time predictive maintenance.

Sub-optimal load dispatch based on static scheduling rather than dynamic conditions.

These issues lead to increased energy waste, higher operational costs, and reduced power output.

2. Solution & Approach
EnergiSense is an AI-driven system designed to address these inefficiencies. The solution combines real-time sensor data, system modeling, and machine learning to create a smart optimization engine. Key components include:

AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance: Machine learning models analyze sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure) to detect anomalies and predict equipment failures before they cause significant energy loss.

Energy Flow Optimization Engine: Uses a digital twin and AI to enable smart load balancing and operational synergy, ensuring power is dispatched efficiently.

3. Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis, model training, and scripting.

Pandas: For data manipulation and processing.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development (Linear Regression, Random Forest).

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

MATLAB / Simulink: For system modeling, simulation, and creating a digital twin.

GitHub: For version control and project management.

4. Proof of Concept Results
As an initial proof of concept, a predictive model was trained to forecast power plant output (PE) based on ambient conditions (AT, V, AP, RH). The Random Forest Regressor model demonstrated exceptional performance on unseen data:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.26 (On average, predictions were off by only 2.26 units).

R-squared (R 
2
 ) Score: 0.96 (The model can explain 96% of the variability in the power output).

These results confirm that the selected features are strong predictors of power plant efficiency, providing a solid foundation for the full optimization system.

5. Project Status & Next Steps
The project is currently in the proof of concept and system design phase.

Next Step: Transitioning the project to MATLAB to build a Simulink model (digital twin) that simulates the power plant's behavior and integrates the AI-driven optimization logic.
